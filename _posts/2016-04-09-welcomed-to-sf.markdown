I have found myself in South of Market staying at a hacker hostel for over a week. While most stay here for business purposes, my trip is for pleasure. I'm visiting a friend form high school to attend a concert and explore the area with her.

I've already seen the Postmates headquarters. Looks really 1337! I see many ads for dev jobs on bus station terminals and lots of hoodies! The guests of the hostel are involved in tech, too.

The restaurants here are appeasing to me. San Francisco's architecture is interesting. Not too high (most likely due to earthquakes and/or NIMBYs), yet not too short.

While I am out here, I look to explore the area for it's natural resources. The mountains, valleys, and cliffs in California are beautiful!

In addition to natural places, I shall be exploring the Computer History Museum.

It's great to back blogging on the internet! A lot has changed since I last posted: I got a apartments, cars, and jobs. I went from writing C# in Microsoft Dynamics CRM to programming in Python on the Django web application framework. Instead of using Windows, I've been diving deep into Linux (particularly Debian). My aptitude in open-source software development has grown significantly as a result.

The advancement of my career has renewed my interest in having my own space on the Internet. I've changed the domain of the site and revamped my social media accounts accordingly. I am excited to get back into web development for my own personal fulfillment!
